We have accomplished panel detection using the pointcloud data from the stereo camera and approaching to the panel by the robot automatically. After approaching the panel, our robot can detect the position and orientation of the wrenches, as well as the valve stem automatically. Now we are able to navigate, recognize wrenches and valve stem, pick the correct wrench, fit the wrench to valve stem, and rotate it with full autonomy.
