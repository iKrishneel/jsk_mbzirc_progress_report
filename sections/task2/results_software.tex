We accomplished Panel detection from the pointcloud of stereo camera and approaching to the panel automatically, but we don't accomplished the recognition of the front side of the panel.

After approaching, our robot can detect the position and rotation of the wrenches and the valve stem also automatically.

Now we could accomplish task2 in full autonomy in a specific case(Panel is facing to the robot and placing in front of the robot).
