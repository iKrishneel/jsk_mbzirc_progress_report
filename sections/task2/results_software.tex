We have accomplished panel detection using 3D point cloud data
from the stereo camera. The robot is able to autonomously navigate
towards the panel once it is detected. After approaching the panel,
the robot can detect the position and orientation of the wrenches, as
well as the valve stem. Once the position and orientations are
detected, the robot can pick up the correct wrench, fit the wrench to
valve stem and rotate the value fully autonoumsly. 

% Now we are able to navigate, recognize wrenches and
% valve stem, pick the correct wrench, fit the wrench to valve stem, and
% rotate it with full autonomy.
