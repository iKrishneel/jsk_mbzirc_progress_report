The lifter of Aero has gone through an upgrade once to increase its
output and maximum height reachability. With its new lifter, the current
version of Aero now has high enough output to rotate the valve stem at
$5N/m$, and it is capable of reaching and turning the valve stem at
the minimum possible height of the panel at $30cm$, as well as the
maximum possible panel height at $100cm$.



We have created a teleoperating system for Aero, and using this
system, together with code adapted from that we have created for HRP2,
we have been able to successfully carry out the wrench picking and
wrench turning part of task 2 with partial autonomy in an
experiment. In this experiment Aero robot is placed 
%was performed by manually aligning  
in front of the
panel. The operator aligns the arm with the wrench and pick up the
wrench through teleoperation. After picking up the wrench, the
operator then aligns the wrench with the valve stem, and fits the
wrench onto it. Then, the robot autonomously generates a circular arc
trajectory and execute it to turn the wrench and the valve stem.
