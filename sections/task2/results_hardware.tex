The lifter of Aero has gone through an upgrade once to increase its output and maximum reach in height. With its new lifter, the current version of Aero now has high enough output to rotate the valve stem at $5N/m$, and it is capable of reaching and turning the valve stem at the minimum possible height of the panel at $30cm$, as well as the maximum possible panel height of $100cm$.

We have created a teleoperating system for Aero, and using this system, together with code adapted from that we have created for HRP2, we have been able to successfully carry out the wrench picking and wrench turning part of task 2 with partial autonomy in an experiment. In our experiment, Aero begins standing in front of the panel. The operator aligns the arm with the wrench and pick up the wrench through teleoperation. After picking up the wrench, the operator then aligns the wrench with the valve stem, fits the wrench onto it. The the robot autonomously generates a circular trajectory and execute it to turn the wrench.
