Our future works in navigation are Searching the panel from whole arena,
detecting the front side of the panel and finer tuning of the robot position.

Then, now we recognize the size of the wrenches by getting the length of hough transform, but the accuracy is not enough.
So we need recognize the size of the head of them to detect the correct one certainly.

Finally, we are going to use handeye feedback control to improve the wrench picking and fitting.
