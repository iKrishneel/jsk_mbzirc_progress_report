Our future work in navigation includes searching for the panel within
the whole arena, detecting the front side of the panel, and finer
control of the robot position and orientation for alignment with the
panel for the task. Currently, the sizes of the wrenches are
determined by the length of the projected lines obtained from hough
transform. However, the accuracy of line estimation can vary based on
image intensity which can affect 
the recognition accuracy.
%recognition of wrench sizes.
 Therefore, we still need to detect the
size of the wrench head in order the determine the correct size
wrench with improved accuracy. Finally, we will be incorporating
the use of a handeye for performing visual feedback control to improve
picking and fitting of the wrench.
