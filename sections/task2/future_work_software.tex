Our future work in navigation includes searching for the panel within the whole arena, detecting the front side of the panel, and finer control of the robot position and orientation for alignment with the panel for the task. Currently, we recognize the size of the wrenches by determining the length of the lines obtained from hough transform. However, the accuracy is not good enough for reliable recognition of wrench sizes. Therefore, we still need to detect the size of the wrench head in order the determine which the correct size wrench is with greater certainly. Finally, we will be incorporating the use of a handeye for performing visual feedback control to improve wrench on picking and fitting.
