For our new gripper design, we will we conducting more tests to determine how reliably the robot can fit the wrench onto the valve stem and turn it. With the results, we will decide whether to equip this new gripper onto the final version of our robot or not.

Regarding our new platform Aero, we are working towards finalizing the design of the mobile base at the moment. After we have built the new version of the base, we will be creating the controller for it and testing it. We will also be integrating camera and force sensor onto the robot for perception. Furthermore, we will also need to finalized our selection of on-board computers for Aero, design and build the mount for them, and install them together with network capabilities to make the system standalone and tether-free.
