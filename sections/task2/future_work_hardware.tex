We are working towards finalizing the design of the mobile base of Aero at the moment. After we have built the new version of the base, we will be creating the controller for it and testing it. We will also be integrating camera and force sensor onto the robot for perception. Furthermore, we will also need to finalized our selection of on-board computers for Aero, design and build the mount for them, and install them to make together with a router to make the system standalone and tether-free.
